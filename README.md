## [E-commerce case study](https://github.com/Yasserz12/E-Commerce-case-study)
This is a Data for E-commerce company, The main goal for the ops team of this company is to serve all retailers in the best timing in order to ensure the best success rate possible

The objective of this task is to:
Analyze error rate ( difference between desired success rate (100%) and the actual success rate), main reasons behind it.

Prioritize the problems to solve in order to have the biggest impact on the success rate, for example, if the error rate is 10% and 50% of the error rate comes from not showing up in 3 hours, so recommend working on service time.

Provide recommendations to the ops team

## [Food Delivery](https://github.com/Yasserz12/food-delivery)
This is a food delivery dataset, for this analysis I used Microsoft Excel, Python and PowerBi, I did clean the data and picked the necessary columns that will help me with the analysis, I was able to get an overall view about the consumers, like their marital status, their ages.. etc, and also getting insights of the most meals that was bought by the consumers

## [NY Hospital Analysis](https://github.com/Yasserz12/Hospital-Analysis)
This is a hospital data in NewYork, i made all the analysis using Excel and PowerBi, i was able to analyze the revenue for each department and each month" May and June" as well as finding out which district in NewYork had the most patients, and it's all shown in the presentation.

## [Sales Analysis Project](https://github.com/Yasserz12/Sales-Report)
This is a dataset of a company with multiple branches across USA. the cleaning and the exploration process were done by Python and the final report is done by Power Bi The Sales report shows some indicators and insights which can help the company for better future decision making, the report shows which City that made revenue the most, which product was most sold and made most profit. and also at which hour customers are active buying the company products which can help the marketing team to to figure out the most suitable time to make ads for the products.

## [Covid Cases and Vaccinations Analysis](https://github.com/Yasserz12/Cases_and_Vaccinations)

This Data is about the cases and the vaccination of Covid 19 in the world and especifically in USA, the analysis were done using SQL and Excel while the visualization was made by using Tableau, this analysis gives us an overview about how the cases were got affected by starting the vaccination in USA, And also it shows the total number of cases in each country, And the most vaccination that was used by all the countries.

# Machine Learning Projects

## [Loan](https://github.com/Yasserz12/Loan-/blob/main/Loan.ipynb)

This Dataset contains information about customers of the Bank and whether they got accepted to take a lone or not, so using these informations I was able to build a predictive system to predict if the next customer will get accepted to get the loan or not. in the project I did data cleaning, feature ebgineering and data visualization to see better the correlation between each feature with the output, and applying Support Vector Classifier algorithm to build the predictive system, after tuning hyperparameters.

## [Wine Quality](https://github.com/Yasserz12/Wine-Quality/blob/main/Wine.ipynb)

This Dataset is about wine quality, giving some features of the wine to determine the quality of the wine. So In this project I build a predictive system to predict the quality of the wine, if it's " good " or " bad ", And I used Random Forest Classifier Algorithm for this data to build the predictive system and I was able to fint the most perfect number of estimators for the algorithm
