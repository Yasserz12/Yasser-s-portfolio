## [Sales Analysis Project](https://github.com/Yasserz12/Sales-Report)
This is a dataset of a company with multiple branches across USA. the cleaning and the exploration process were done by Python and the final report is done by Power Bi The Sales report shows some indicators and insights which can help the company for better future decision making, the report shows which City that made revenue the most, which product was most sold and made most profit. and also at which hour customers are active buying the company products which can help the marketing team to to figure out the most suitable time to make ads for the products.

## [Covid Cases and Vaccinations Analysis](https://github.com/Yasserz12/Cases_and_Vaccinations)

This Data is about the cases and the vaccination of Covid 19 in the world and especifically in USA, the analysis were done using SQL and Excel while the visualization was made by using Tableau, this analysis gives us an overview about how the cases were got affected by starting the vaccination in USA, And also it shows the total number of cases in each country, And the most vaccination that was used by all the countries.

# Mini Machine Learning Projects

## [Loan](https://github.com/Yasserz12/Loan-/blob/main/Loan.ipynb)

This Dataset contains information about customers of the Bank and whether they got accepted to take a lone or not, so using these informations I was able to build a predictive system to predict if the next customer will get accepted to get the loan or not. in the project I did data cleaning, feature ebgineering and data visualization to see better the correlation between each feature with the output, and applying Support Vector Classifier algorithm to build the predictive system, after tuning hyperparameters.

## [Wine Quality](https://github.com/Yasserz12/Wine-Quality/blob/main/Wine.ipynb)

This Dataset is about wine quality, giving some features of the wine to determine the quality of the wine. So In this project I build a predictive system to predict the quality of the wine, if it's " good " or " bad ", And I used Random Forest Classifier Algorithm for this data to build the predictive system and I was able to fint the most perfect number of estimators for the algorithm

## [Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/Yasserz12/Customer-Segmentation/blob/main/Customer_segmentation%20kmeans.ipynb)

this Dataset contains customers' informations like, the annual income, the score ..etc, i used k-means algorithm for customer segmentation with the best hyperparameters, number of clusters, etc

## [Parkinson](https://github.com/Yasserz12/Parkinson./blob/main/Parkinsons%20.ipynb)

This Dataset is about the Parkinson's disease, with the informations included in this Data i was able to build a predictive system to predict whether this person as that parkinson disease or not, i used support vector classifier algoritm to build this system
